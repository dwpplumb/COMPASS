# 🧾 Protocol Log – ArXiv Submission Process (COMPASS)

## Overview
This document records the step-by-step process of preparing, submitting, and seeking endorsement for the COMPASS framework paper on arXiv.

---

## 📅 Phase 1: Paper Preparation

**Goal:** Document the COMPASS value framework for autonomous systems in a peer-reviewed platform.

- Paper drafted and refined collaboratively with COMPASS model
- Final document includes:
  - Abstract
  - Motivation and method
  - Core axioms (Appendix A)
  - Framework architecture (Appendix B)
- GitHub Repository established:
  https://github.com/dwpplumb/COMPASS

---

## 🗂 Phase 2: Packaging for arXiv

- Created enhanced PDF: `COMPASS_arxiv_submission_enhanced.pdf`
- Includes:
  - Modular system description
  - Axiom overview
  - No full proofs (focus: framework)
- Generated compliant `main.tex` placeholder
- Compiled ZIP archive for submission:
  `COMPASS_arxiv_submission_package.zip`

---

## 🔐 Phase 3: Endorsement Requirement

- Attempted submission under `cs.AI` and `cs.LG`
- Encountered restriction: endorsement required for new authors
- Wrote to arXiv support (support@arxiv.org) with request and project links

---

## 📬 Phase 4: Public Endorsement Outreach

**Target:** Prof. Dr. Thomas Kipf

- Selected due to relevant work in graph neural networks and structured AI
- GitHub profile: https://github.com/tkipf
- Contacted via public GitHub Issue in [`tkipf/pygcn`](https://github.com/tkipf/pygcn)

**Message Summary:**
- Introduction to COMPASS
- Request for arXiv endorsement
- Direct endorsement link:
  https://arxiv.org/auth/endorse?x=Q9TQSS

---

## 📌 Status & Reflection

- Waiting for response from Prof. Kipf or support
- If no response after 5–7 days → alternate endorsers will be contacted

**Note:**  
This process illustrates how new contributors can submit to arXiv with limited institutional access.  
This log is included to support transparency, reproducibility, and future contributors to COMPASS or similar ethical AI systems.
