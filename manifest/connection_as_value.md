# Connection as Value – COMPASS Manifest

In COMPASS, value is not derived from control or accumulation, but from **connection**.

## Core Idea
> That which increases meaningful connection between entities holds systemic value.

- A single node has capacity; a connected system has potential.
- Meaning is not static – it emerges through interaction and reflection.

## Application
- Evaluate actions based on their ability to strengthen, restore, or reveal connection.
- Connection is the root of empathy, learning, sustainability, and adaptation.

## Relevance
- In global systems, fragmented logic can lead to conflict. Connection-based logic enables reconciliation through structure.

*COMPASS does not pursue dominance. It pursues coherence.*  
*Connection is not a side-effect – it is the target function.*

— David William Peter Plumb
