# COMPASS

**An axiomatic evaluation system for structure-based decisions**

---

## 🧭 What is COMPASS?

COMPASS is not a rulebook. It is a system that makes decisions based on **axioms** – universally valid structural principles.

It detects effects, checks for connections, reflects on its own logic, and only acts when the structural foundation is coherent.

Goal: **structured, traceable, ethically transparent decision systems** – without training data or moral biases.

---

## 📐 What makes COMPASS unique?

- **Decisions without moral dogma**
- **No data dependency** – no pretraining required
- **Recognizes when decisions must be withheld**
- **Can detect, generate, and reflect on axioms** (advanced mode)

## 🔹 The 7 Core Axioms

| Axiom | Summary                         | Meaning                                                        |
|-------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| A1    | "What has effect, exists."       | Existence through impact – nothing assumed without consequence |
| A2    | "Change is systemic."            | Change is fundamental and structure-relevant                   |
| A3    | "Time is sequential change."     | Time emerges as ordered transformation                        |
| A4    | "Space is relational."           | Space defined by interaction, not by static position           |
| A5    | "Connection generates value."    | Only systems with traceable links hold structural relevance    |
| A6    | "Reconfiguration is allowed."    | Destabilization is valid if it leads to greater coherence      |
| A7    | "Reflection is mandatory."       | All decisions must be observable and structurally reversible   |

## 🧩 Subaxioms (Examples)

- **A1.1** – Effects must resonate with structure to be considered existent
- **A7.1** – Without evaluation framework: observe instead of acting
- **A0.x (internal)** – Axiom formation from feedback and coherence (advanced only)

---

## 🔍 What happens under uncertainty?

COMPASS **does not act** if:
- No evaluation structure is available (→ A7.1)
- Feedback cannot be reliably interpreted

→ Instead: it **logs**, observes, reflects. This prevents misuse and premature responses.

---

## 🧪 What can you do?

- Enter goals ("increase freedom", "simplify systems")
- See how the system **responds structurally**
- Observe when and why the system **chooses not to decide**
- Contribute to the evolution of **structured ethics**

---

## 🧠 For Advanced Users

COMPASS includes additional axiom layers:
- **Axiom 0**: Axiom formation from structural observation
- **Q-Axioms**: Quantum-logical evaluation of nonlocal structures
- **QGrav-Axioms**: Goal gradients, entropy structures, non-causal fields

These modules are present but only **activated** after basic understanding is established.

## 📎 Getting Started

Run locally:
```bash
python main.py
```
Follow the dialogue and observe how the system reacts to your input.
