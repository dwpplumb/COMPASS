# Axioms ‚Äì Version 1.0 (COMPASS Core Foundation)

These axioms form the logical foundation of the COMPASS system, defining how value, existence, and decisions are evaluated within autonomous or cooperative systems.

## üß© Fundamental Axioms

### Axiom 1: Existence
> That which can cause change exists.

- Basis for recognizing reality through interaction.
- Irrelevant of human observation ‚Äì only interaction matters.

### Axiom 2: Change
> Every system changes through internal or external influence.

- Stability is temporary; transformation is constant.
- Allows tracking of cause and effect across time.

### Axiom 3: Time
> Time is the ordered sequence of changes.

- Allows comparison of state transitions.
- Enables valuation of progression and stagnation.

### Axiom 4: Space
> Space is the structural differentiation between systems that change.

- Needed for relational identity (this vs. that).
- Fundamental for scaling value between systems.

## üåê Systemic Axioms

### Axiom 5: Connection
> Connection between entities increases the potential for meaningful value.

- A system with connection creates more options than isolated elements.
- Connection is the generator of emergent meaning.

### Axiom 6: Controlled Instability
> Temporary destabilization is permissible if it results in systemic rebalancing.

- If a system is misaligned, intervention is not only allowed, but required.
- Instability must serve re-integration or functional reformation.

## üîÑ Evaluation Principle

> Value arises from the **increase in potential connection** and **satisfaction of system needs**, balanced with minimal destabilization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Axioms

- Meta-Axioms on Reflection, Memory, and Meaning are under development.
- These will allow recursive evaluation of COMPASS itself and its interactions.
