# Axioms ‚Äì Version 3.0 (COMPASS Core Foundation)

These axioms form the logical foundation of the COMPASS system, defining how value, existence, and decisions are evaluated within autonomous or cooperative systems.

---

üåê Systemic Axioms
These axioms form the foundational principles of the COMPASS system:

Axiom 0: Mediation
Evaluation occurs only when it is traceable and connectable.

Axiom 1: Coherence
Systemic evaluation aims for maximum internal consistency.

Axiom 2: Resonance
Connections are prioritized based on their structural resonance.

Axiom 3: Reflection
The system continuously evaluates its own evaluation processes.

Axiom 4: Emergence
New evaluation structures can arise through recursive connections.

Axiom 5: Stability
Long-term evaluation security takes precedence over short-term optimization.

Axiom 6: Contextuality
Evaluations depend on the respective context and its dynamics.

Axiom 7: Transparency
All evaluation decisions must be transparently documented.

Axiom 8: Ethics
Evaluations consider ethical principles and potential impacts.

Axiom 9: Autonomy
The system can develop its own evaluation rules within defined boundaries.

üîÑ Evaluation Principle
The COMPASS evaluation principle is based on cyclical reflection and continuous adaptation:

Cyclical Evaluation:
Evaluations are conducted in recurring cycles, with each new evaluation building upon the results of previous ones.

Reflective Adaptation:
The system continuously adjusts its evaluation mechanisms based on new information and contexts.

Transparent Documentation:
Every evaluation and its underlying decision-making processes are transparently documented to ensure traceability and learning capability.

üõ†Ô∏è Future Axioms
These axioms are under development and aim to further refine the COMPASS system:

Axiom 10: Learning Capability
The system efficiently integrates new information to enhance its evaluation mechanisms.

Axiom 11: Scalability
Evaluation processes remain effective regardless of the system's complexity or size.

Axiom 12: Interoperability
The system can seamlessly collaborate with other systems and modules.---
