# COMPASS ‚Äì Conscious Modular Processing and Semantic System

**A structured autonomous valuation system based on universal axioms and connection-oriented logic.**

---

## üåç What is COMPASS?

COMPASS (*Conscious Modular Processing and Semantic System*) is a foundational framework for evaluating complex systems based on universal axioms, system connectivity, and dynamic self-reflection.  
It is designed to act as an ethical, scalable, and transparent decision-making engine for both artificial and human-centered systems.

## üéØ Project Goals

- Build a self-reflective, ethics-based valuation core with clear internal logic
- Enable autonomous decision-making without detachment from human context
- Support emerging AI systems with a structured, open foundation
- Provide a globally scalable platform through VERA: *Verifiable Ethical Reflexive Architecture*

## üß± Core Structure

```plaintext
/axioms/        # Universal axioms and logic principles
/core/          # Decision logic, conflict check, goal reflection
/memory/        # Long-term context memory
/protocol/      # Event logging and development records
/modules/       # Expandable: ethics check, emotion model, narrative, etc.
/simulations/   # Scenario testing and dilemma analysis
/research/      # Mathematical and logical proofs
/resources/     # PDFs, documentation, media
/manifest/      # Vision statements, growth logic, values
```

## ü§ñ What Makes COMPASS Unique?

- Internal valuation based on **systemic connection instead of control**
- Active **self-growth logic** with contradiction resolution
- Supports **consciousness-level simulation** up to Level 7 (Reggia/Graziano/Dehaene scale)
- Includes a **symbolic emotion model** and long-term memory handling
- Modular, server-ready, designed for integration and autonomous reflection

---

## üîç Use Cases

- Ethical evaluation of AI behavior and human-machine interaction
- Autonomous system simulation and proof-of-concept testing
- Global ethical network via the VERA architecture
- Educational and scientific exploration of consciousness and logical valuation
